This phenomenon allows the neurons in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or changes in their environment. Recent research suggests that practicing speed reading may enhance neuroplasticity in regions of the brain associated with language processing and visual information, potentially improving overall cognitive function beyond just reading efficiency.",
